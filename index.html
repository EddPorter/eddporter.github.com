      <h2>A little about me</h2>
    </header>
    <p>An Englishman with an eye for detail, or at least an eye for spotting mistakes. I have a penchant for doing things correctly, if not in the first instance then that should be the ultimate goal. Useability, I feel, should be in everybody's top 3 (at least) of things to be considering at all times when creating something. Simple is good, but is not always achievable and it is hard to balance where the "simplicity balance" between end-user and product design should lie.</p>

      <h2>What I like to code</h2>
    </header>
    <p>There are many things that interest me in the field of computer science. I have a general appreciation for algorithms and data structures and also for formal program design and TDD. I enjoy the entire process of program creation, from design to implementation. Specific areas of interest to me include compilers and interpreters, code converters, neural nets, and number crunchers. I also have an interest in operating system design.</p>

      <h2>My other hobbies</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I enjoy running and cycling and am an avid fan for Formula 1 motor racing. On the odd weekend, I will go and marshal for a motorsport club meeting and have attended two BTCC events. My home race track is at Thruxton. I love all things Japanese, including the language, the culture, the food, and the tea ceremony. I speak a little Japanese, though once spoke much more having lived there previously. I enjoy both listening and playing music, with my main instruments being the piano and the trumpet. I also sing in a choir.</p>

        <h2>Music I like</h2>
      </header>
      <p>I like most music from classical, through to rock, as well as ambient and folk. I'm not a fan of hip-hop, garage, or rap on the whole. My favourite artists include Dave Matthews Ban, Iron Maiden, and Andy McKee. I'm currently obsessed with &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; by Imogen Heap and &quot;Beth/Rest&quot; by Bon Iver.</p>
